In a Firebase project, data might not be written to the database even though the client-side code appears correct. This can be caused by a security rule that prevents the write operation, or a timing issue where the client believes the write has succeeded but the server hasn't processed it yet.  The absence of error messages makes debugging challenging.  Example code (JavaScript):

```javascript
db.ref('users/' + userId).set({name: 'John Doe'})
.then(() => console.log('Data written successfully'))
.catch(error => console.error('Error writing data: ', error));
```
This code *appears* correct, but could fail due to rules or a server-side issue.
