# Silent Firebase Data Write Failures

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug issue in Firebase: silent failures when writing data.  The problem stems from a lack of informative error messages when writes are blocked by security rules or when there are asynchronous timing problems.

## The Problem
The provided `bug.js` file contains JavaScript code that attempts to write data to a Firebase Realtime Database.  While the code includes `.then()` and `.catch()` blocks, it often fails silentlyâ€”no error message is shown even when the write fails. This makes identifying the root cause incredibly challenging.

## The Solution
The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes Firebase's `.on('value', ...)` to add a listener. This listener immediately catches the absence of data in the intended path after the write attempt.  It provides clear feedback to the user or developer about the failure, even in the absence of a typical error message from the `.set()` method.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a Firebase project and add the appropriate configuration.
3. Follow the instructions in the README to run both bug and solution files. Observe the behavior of each.
